The library should be compatible with Linux, MAC OS X, Windows. It may or may not work with other operating system (FreeBSD, Android, IOS, etc.).

The project uses the following library: time.

Installation
---------
* You must already have a working EiffelStudio. If you don't, install it.
* Rename the library folder (containing this README.md file) to "neural_network".
* You need to add the "neural_network" library folder in the "contrib/library" folder of EiffelStudio. Normally, this folder is in "C:\Program Files\Eiffel Software\".
* Create a project and add the libraries you need (".ecf" file) in your project. (You can use the EIFFEL_LIBRARY environment variable to add those libraries. For example: $EIFFEL_LIBRARY/contrib/library/neural_network/neural_network.ecf .
